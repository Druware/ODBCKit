Changelog
=========
# 01/07/2022
    * Updated to support Apple Silicon

# 10/29/2012
    * consolidated GenDB definitions into a single file to remove duplicate 
      definition warnings
      
# 07/17/2012
    * defaultEncoding was not carrying forward to cloned connections
    * reverted defaultEncoding to NSMacOSRoman as too many drivers still fail to
      properly implement unicode support.   users that need UTF8 or other will 
      need to set the defaultEncoding upon create.
    * altered all child objects from the Connection to carry the defaultEncoding
      through the init chain
    
# 06/21/2012
    * updated version, fixed source to omit known broken preparedstatement code
    

# 09/20/2011
    * Added connectionString (equates to DSN) to ODBCConnection for better 
        support of the GenDB protocol

# 09/17/2011
    - updated to xcode 4.1 / Lion
    - removed ODBCParameter and ODBCPreparedStatement from compile

12/27/2010
	- transitioned to GenDB Protocol implementation.
	- added further HeaderDoc comments with a goal of moving entirely to 
	  HeaderDoc style documentation
	- adjusted copyrights to include 2011.

11/29/2010
	- removed references to ODBCPreparedStatement which is currently broken and 
	  should not have been included.
	  
11/16/2010
	- fixed a bug with unicode databases (MSSQL Server 2008) and char/varchar 
	  datatypes truncating the result

04/07/2010
	- fixed a potential leak in ODBCLogin
	- rebuilt with x86_64 support enabled to allow use with 64 bit drivers

08/05/2009
	- detailed check of possible object leaks, should prevent the occasional 
	  reported issues of problems with extrememly large recordsets.
	- added asString:(NSStringEncoding)encoding method
	- altered record loading to better deal with TEXT / VARTEXT / VARBINARY
	  data types.

05/15/2009
	- rebuilt with garbage collection enabled
	
11/15/2008
	ODBCLogin 
	- added new icon to the kit, changed the default login icon to the new icon.

09/30/2008
	ODBCRecordset
    - resolved issue 2138425 (empty record in recordset)
	
09/18/2008
	ODBCLogin
	  - Added support for custom icon in the login panel, will alter the existing
	    icon to something more professional when new artwork is available.
		(void)setIcon:(NSImage)value; // icon size is 96x96 scaled proportionally.

09/17/2008 
  Wrapped up Psuedo Cursor support.  Will need to revisit testing for full 
	cursor support when/if a driver is avaialable with full cursor support.  
	
09/09/2008
  ODBCConnection & ODBCRecordset
	- added enableCursors property to allow the user to enable cursors as needed.
	  the default functionality is to work without them.  If this is enabled and
	  the driver does not support them, the ODBCKit will attempt to fake it using
	  an in memory implementation of the recordset.
	- Cleaned up ALL warnings in build.
  ODBCRecord & ODBCField
	- need to alter both to preload and cache data values for the psuedoCursor
	  handling.
	
09/08/2008
  ODBCRecordset returns EXC_BAD_ACCESS on moveFirst;

09/07/2008
  ODBCConnection is inconsistant on connect with DSN
	- fixed if() logic in connect to choose between SQLDRiverConnect and SQLConnect.
  
09/04/2008
  ODBCConnection connect method fails to connect when DSN is Connection String
	- altered connect to use SQLDriverConnect when DSN is Connection String
	- added drivers array to store driver information
	- Connection String doesn't translate Driver={Name} - Fixed, incorrect param on API call.

10/30/2007
  Leopard Issues
	- Recordset Navigation fails - Started research
	- altered back to using SQLFetch (FetchScroll has issues)

01/11/2007
  ODBCLogin
  - fixed - [ 1633238 ] Login Panel does not close on Cancel
    http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1633238&group_id=177561&atid=881726
  ODBCRecordset
  - fixed - [ 1633385 ] Update Queries hand Application

11/28/2006
  ODBCField
  - Identified and fixed a bug where the PostgreSQL driver(s) would return a 
    char * for a date that could not be initialised as an NSDate by the 
	constructor

11/17/2006
  ODBCConnection / ODBCRecordset
  - Isolated and killed a bug that was leaving connections flagged as 'open' in
    the ODBC Driver, causing issues with the Actual drivers. 
	
11/13/2006
  ODBCRecordset
  - added dictionaryFromRecordset method to return an NSDictionary 
    representation of the Recordset
	
11/09/2006
  ODBCConnection
  - added execCommandAsync & related helper functions
  - added openAsync & related helper functions

11/06/2006
  ODBCConnection
  - added connectAsync
  ODBCLogin
  - modified to use connectAsync

11/01/2006
  - added defaultUser and defaultPasswod to ODBCLogin.
  - added datasourceFilter to ODBCConnection and ODBCLogin to allow the developer 
    to have the datasources list filtered to those matching simple string match 
	of the filter.
  - identified an issue with the MSSQL driver and derived columns containing long
    data, yet returning a size of 4.  Temporary workaround in the ODBCKit uses 
	a hardcoded size of 1024 for all columns.

10/28/2006
  - added defaultDSN method to the ODBCLogin class to provide a way for the UI 
    to default to a given DSN.  Default User and Password should also be added.

10/03/2006
  - reworked Column init to deal with quirks of different drivers when dealing with
    timestamps and datetimes.

  - added -(ODBCField *)fieldByIndex:(long)fieldIndex;
  ODBCRecord
  - added -(ODBCField *)fieldByIndex:(long)fieldIndex;

09/11/2006
