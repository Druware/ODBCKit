ODBC Query Tool Todo List
======================

# High Priority
* If multiple result sets exist, only display the last one.

# Cosmetic

* Improve syntax highlighting to handle comments
* Add preferences dialog to support changing fonts.
* If the connection changes, reset the schema and clear the query area

# Nice to Have
* expand schema view to include columns on drill down (indexes and keys would 
  be nice)
