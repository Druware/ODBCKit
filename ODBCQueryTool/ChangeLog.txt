  - Converted to ARC
  - removed Automator Actions into seperate project

07/19/2012
  - altered login process to more gracefully display connection errors rather 
    than treat them as cancelled connections.
  - removed bogus 'status' from the status bar prior to connection

06/16/2012
  - added query timers to the status bar in the Query Tool.
  - fixed a bug in ODBCLogin that prevented errors from being passed up to the
    GUI. This is useful for trapping bad DSNs, which otherwise failed with a 
    "Connection cancelled." with no futher information.
  - The login change required minor changes in MyDocument to catch these errors and
    present them in a nice format. Also note the change in the onConnection
    call to handle the new state, "connection exists but isn't working".
  - changed a number of references to initWithCString to stringWithFormat, as the
    former is deprecated.
  - added ODBCConnection.database to return the current "catalog" (database).
  - updated MyDocument.onExecuteQuery to call ODBCConnection.database and look
    for changes in the "current catalog". if it changes, the SchemaDataSource
    is re-set to update the schema display (on the left) and mention the change
    in the status display at the bottom of the document window.
  - added ODBCConnection.readOnly which returns whether or not the connection
    is to a read-only data source. You can still send updates to such a beast,
    but they simply won't do anything. This code is currently unused, but potentially
    useful.
  - various fixes for different drivers. PD versions of MySQL, Firebird and SQLite
    are known to work.
  - fixed a number of ODBA calls that were passing in bad handles
  - changed error messages to a consistant format, proper camel casing throughout,
    periods on errors from the UI and no periods from errors from lower levels
  - change release to drain on autorelease pools in ODBCConnection
  - lots of whitespace and minor formatting, more internal documentation
    (but not enough).

  - changed result view to adjust column widths the the length of the fields as
    returned instead of an assumed default size.
  - fixed a bug in the title when the file has not been saved
  - fixed 'save results as' to properly display the save panel and choose a 
    proper path for the save file.

  - started ressearch into long standing edit bug that can lock up the editor 
	when editing the 0,0 char in the text view eafter they have been entered 
	once.
  - fixed a bug where the last column in the results window would be squished to
    8 pixels wide.
  - found and fixed initial issue with highlighting that caused edits at the 
    start of any line to cause a random editor hang.
  - bumped version number to 0.5.0 in prep for a weekend release.

05/21/2010
  - started syntax highlighting rework to better handle sql syntax styles also 
    abstract enough that it could be used in other sql tools in the system.

04/28/2009
  - merged Connect/Disconnect button into a single button
  - roughed in export results functionality

03/12/2009
  - resolved long standing bug with schema browser to enable it to display
  - began code cleanup geared towards building a stand alone product for use 
    against ODBC datasources.

11/13/2008

  - initial support for schema browser added.
