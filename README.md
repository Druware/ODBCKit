# ODBCKit

The ODBCKit is an open source framework for Cocoa developers to leverage the underlying Open Database Connectivity resources in the business network. Built with the intent of providing an easy and approachable toolkit for Cocoa Developers, it has evolved into a little bit more, also providing a simple graphical query tool as well as a couple of Automator Actions to the provide user level access to the ODBC databases

What this means in the real world is that using this toolkit, it should be easier to write and maintain applications that have ready access to enterprise level data sources like Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server and others. Why is this a big deal? well, one of the biggest concerns with the Mac platform is business applications. If there is an easy way to create and maintain applications that use the same enterprise database engines as their Windows counterparts, expanding the Mac in to the world of big business and corporate development becomes just a little bit easier.

By making this open source, specifically under the BSD license model, the toolkit is readily usable in both commercial and open source projects without concern for the viral nature of some of the open source alternatives while allowing users to guide the forward evolution of the project through both suggestions and code contributions.

Though we do all of the development on this project under the auspices of Druware, we have no commercial products built upon it that pay for it. If you find it useful, make a contribution to the SourceForge.net ODBCKit project. All of those donations go directly to the people writing the code and doing the maintenance.
